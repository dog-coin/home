## ECOSYSTEM

Dogπcoin is an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building. Dogπcoin is our first token and allows users to hold Billions or even Trillions of them.  Nicknamed the DOGECOIN KILLER, this Heco-20 ONLY token can remain well under a penny and still outpace Dogecoin in a small amount of time (relatively speaking). Popular worldwide, and already up thousands of percent, Dogπcoin ($DOGπ) is the first cryptocurrency token to be listed and incentivized on DOGπSwap, our decentralized exchange.   

### HO​W TO BUY

The only place to buy or sell Dogπ safely is on MDEX. 

There are some centralized exchanges that have listed Dogπ, but CEXs have a history of locking funds. 

If you can, it is safer to trade on a decentralized exchange like MDEX.

BONE is not available yet , but will be able to acquire soon.
